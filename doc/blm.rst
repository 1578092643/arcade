Black Lives Matter
==================

I started this site and this library to help everyone not only learn how to
program, but also learn to enjoy programming.
I like things light-hearted and apolitical so everyone feels welcome.

But a whole segment of our population is held down by systematic racism,
police brutality, and a culture of minimizing when they speak out.
Anyone who shouts "all lives matter" and "I stand for the flag" is failing
to *listen*.

There are so few black programmers, and exceedingly few black female programmers.
The problems run deep, and it is up to all of us to fix them. Demand justice,
demand reform. Better yet, don't just demand it, step up and be a part of it.
