Pygame Comparison
=================

The Python Arcade Library has the same target audience as the well-known
Pygame library. So how do they differ?

.. [#f1] To support rotation and/or scaling, PyGame programs must write the image to a surface, transform the surface,
         then create a sprite out of the surface. This takes a lot of CPU. Arcade off-loads all these operations to the
         graphics card.
.. [#f2] When creating a sprite from an image, PyGame will load the image from the disk every time. The user must
         cache the image with their own code for better performance. Arcade does this automatically.
.. [#f5] A programmer can achieve a similar result by drawing to a surface, then drawing drawing the surface to the screen.
.. [#f3] Polygon hit box, rotation allowed
.. [#f4] Rectangular hit box, no rotation allowed
