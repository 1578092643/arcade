How to Compile
==============

Windows
^^^^^^^

From the base directory, there are three batch files that can be run:

* ``make`` - This compiles the source, installs the package on the local
  computer, compiles the documentation, and runs all the unit tests.
* ``makedoc`` - This compiles the documentation.
* ``makefast`` - This compiles and installs the source code. It does not
  create the documentation or run any unit tests.
