Suggested Curriculum
====================

The Arcade library is designed to support education. We expect
students will progressively add to their knowledge.

Arcade's theme: "Only advanced actions should require advanced knowledge."

Stage 1:
--------

Draw
^^^^

* Learn to call drawing commands and create your own drawings.
* Learn to use variables to change your drawing.


Stage 2:
--------

Draw and animate with functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Learn to create functions, so you can make your own draw_tree commands
* Learn to animate with functions and static variables
  (or skip this and use classes later. Static function variables are weird.)

Stage 3:
--------

Learn to use loops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Learn to loop
* Learn nested loops (learn to use nested loops to draw grids, triangles, etc.)

Stage 4:
--------

Lists
^^^^^

* Working with lists
* Array-backed grids (This can be pushed back in the curriculum easily)

Stage 5:
--------

Object-oriented programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Object-oriented programming
* User control of items
* Sprites

Stage 6:
--------

Other topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do these in any order:

* Physics engines
* Files
* Code libraries
* Searching
* Sorting
* Recursion
* String formatting
* Decorators
