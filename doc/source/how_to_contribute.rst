How to Contribute
=================

We would love to have you contribute to the project! There are several
ways that you can do so. Here are four of them:

* **Community** - Post your projects, code, screen-shots, and discuss the Arcade library on the `Python Arcade SubReddit`_.
* **Suggest improvements** - Post bugs and enhancement requests at the `Github Issue List`_.
* **Document** - Edit the reStructuredText_ and docstrings_ to make the Arcade
  documentation better.
* **Test** - Improve the unit testing.
* **Code** - Contribute bug fixes and enhancements to the code.

For updating the documentation or improving the code, you will need
to understand the :ref:`directory-structure`, :ref:`how-to-compile`,
and :ref:`how-to-submit-changes`.
