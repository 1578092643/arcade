Solitaire Tutorial
==================

blah

.. warning::

    This tutorial requires Arcade version 2.4, which is currently in Alpha.
    You'll need to specifically install it, as 2.3 will be default. The API
    for the Pymunk interface is still subject to change.



Open a Window
-------------

To begin with, let's start with a program that will use Arcade to open a blank
window. It also has stubs for methods we'll fill in later. Try this code and make
sure you can run it. It should pop open a black window.
