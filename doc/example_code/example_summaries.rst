This code demonstrates how to use the TextureAnimationSprite class from the Arcade library to animate a sprite using keyframes. Keyframes are specific points in an animation sequence where a change in an object's position or appearance occurs. In this example, the code creates a TextureAnimationSprite object by loading a series of textures representing different frames of a walking animation for a character, specifying the duration for each frame, and then updating the sprite's animation based on the passage of time. This allows for smooth and controlled animation of sprites in a game or interactive application.

It showcases how to create bullets that are aimed based on the player's input (mouse click), calculate the angle of trajectory using trigonometry, handle the movement of the bullets, detect collisions with other sprites (coins in this case), and update the game logic accordingly (removing coins upon collision, tracking the score, removing bullets when they fly off-screen). By incorporating these elements, the example illustrates the concept of handling sprite interactions and creating a dynamic game environment.

sprite_bullets_enemy_aims.py
----------------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/sprite_bullets_enemy_aims.png

Source: :ref:`sprite_bullets_enemy_aims`

This code demonstrates how to implement a mechanism for enemies to shoot bullets aimed at the player in a game developed using the Arcade library. The concept involves calculating the angle between the enemy and the player to determine the direction in which the bullet should travel. By consistently updating the angle each frame and setting the bullet's velocity accordingly, the enemies can shoot bullets accurately towards the player's location. Additionally, the code includes logic to remove bullets when they move off-screen, enhancing the game's performance and ensuring efficient use of resources.

sprite_bullets_periodic.py
--------------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/sprite_bullets_periodic.png

Source: :ref:`sprite_bullets_periodic`

This example demonstrates how to implement periodic shooting behavior for enemies in a game using the Arcade library in Python. The key concept here is utilizing a timer mechanism to track the time elapsed since the last shot was fired by an enemy. By comparing this elapsed time against a predetermined firing interval, the enemy sprite can be programmed to shoot bullets at regular intervals. This approach enables game developers to create dynamic and challenging gameplay scenarios where enemies shoot bullets in a controlled and consistent manner.

sprite_bullets_random.py
------------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/sprite_bullets_random.png

Source: :ref:`sprite_bullets_random`

This example demonstrates how to create enemies that shoot bullets at random intervals in a game using the Arcade library. The code sets up enemy sprites positioned in the top-left and top-right corners of the screen. By looping through each enemy, the program randomly selects a 1 in 200 chance (adjusted based on delta time) for the enemy to shoot a bullet downwards. If the random selection triggers, a bullet sprite is created and added to the bullet list with specific properties to make it move. The bullets are updated each frame, and if they move off-screen, they are removed from the list. This concept showcases how to implement random behavior for enemy actions in a game.

sprite_change_coins.py
----------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/sprite_change_coins.png

Source: :ref:`sprite_change_coins`

This example demonstrates how to change a sprite's appearance once it is interacted with, such as when a player collects an item in a game. By updating the texture of the sprite and keeping track of its state (in this case, whether it has been collected), the code illustrates a way to visually represent changes in sprite objects during gameplay without removing or eliminating them entirely.
